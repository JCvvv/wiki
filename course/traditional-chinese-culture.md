The Chinese are said to have discovered and used tea since the Shen Nong era, less than 4,700 years ago. Up to now, Chinese still have the custom of substituting tea for ceremony. Chaozhou Gongfu tea, as a classical school of Chinese tea culture, concentrates the essence of the Chinese tea ceremony culture, and has been selected as a representative of the Chinese tea ceremony in the national intangible cultural heritage.

**II. Directions:** *Please translate the following passage into English.*

饺子在宋代的时候传入到了少数民族的蒙古。饺子传到了蒙古后，很快受到了蒙古豪爽奔放的性格的影响。饺子在蒙古语中的读音类似于“匾食”。饺子的样式也由原来馅小皮薄变成了馅大皮厚的样子。随着蒙古帝国的征伐，扁食传到了世界各地。因此就出现了俄罗斯饺子、哈萨克斯坦饺子、朝鲜饺子等多个品种的饺子。蒙古帝国给中国饺子向世界的传播做出了极大的贡献。在明代的书籍资料上也证实了这点。

Dumplings were introduced to Mongolia, an ethnic minority country, during the Song Dynasty. After the dumplings were introduced to Mongolia, they were soon influenced by the bold and unrestrained character of the Mongolian people. The pronunciation of "饺子" in Mongolian is similar to "匾食". The style of the dumpling also changed from a small filling with thin wrapper to a large filling with thick wrapper. Along with the Mongol Empire's expedition, "匾食" spread to different places of the world. As a result, many kinds of dumplings appeared, such as Russian dumplings, Kazakhstan dumplings, Korean dumplings, etc. The Mongol Empire contributed greatly to the spread of Chinese dumplings to the world. This is also confirmed by the books and documents of the Ming Dynasty.

**III. Directions:** *Please translate the following passage into English.*

中国山水画，简称"山水画"，是以山川自然景观为主要描写对象的中国画。它形成于魏晋南北朝时期，但尚未从人物画中完全分离。隋唐时始独立，五代、北宋时趋于成熟，成为中国画的重要画科。

中国山水画是中国人情思中最为厚重的沉淀。游山玩水的大陆文化意识，以山为德、水为性的内在修为意识，[咫尺天涯](https://baike.so.com/doc/1070484-1132691.html)的视错觉意识，一直成为山水画演绎的中轴主线。从山水画中，我们可以集中体味中国画的意境、格调、气韵和色调。再没有哪个一个画可能够像山水画那样给国人以更多的情感。

Chinese landscape painting, or "landscape painting" for short, is a Chinese painting that mainly depicts the natural landscape of mountains and rivers. It was formed during the Wei, Jin, North and South Dynasties, but had not yet been completely separated from figure painting. It became independent during the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and matured during the Five Dynasties and the Northern Song Dynasty, becoming an important genre of Chinese painting. Chinese landscape painting is the heaviest sediment of Chinese people's emotions. The consciousness of continental culture of playing in the mountains and rivers, the consciousness of inner cultivation with mountains as virtue and water as nature, and the consciousness of visual illusion of “so close, yet worlds apart” have always become the main axis of the interpretation of landscape painting. From landscape painting, we can focus on the mood, style, charm and tone of Chinese painting. There is no other painting that can give more emotions to the Chinese people as landscape painting does.## Text B  Chinese Calligraphy

中国书法是一门古老的汉字的书写艺术，从甲骨文、石鼓文、金文（钟鼎文）演变而为大篆、小篆、隶书，至定型于东汉、魏、晋的草书、楷书、行书等。中国书法是一种很独特的视觉艺术，汉字是中国书法中的重要因素，因为中国书法是在中国文化里产生、发展起来的，而汉字是中国文化的基本要素之一。中国书法，以汉字为依托，是区别于其他种类书法的主要标志。

Chinese calligraphy is an ancient art of writing Chinese characters, which evolved from oracle bone inscriptions, inscriptions on drum-shaped stone blocks, and inscription in bronze (Zhongding script) into the Great Seal Script, Small Seal Script, and Official Script, to the Cursive Script, Regular Script, and Running Script, which were set in the Eastern Han, Wei, and Jin Dynasties.

汉语方言是汉民族语言的地域性变体。汉语方言的内部发展规律服从于全民族共同语，同时又具有不同于其他方言的特征，在语音、词汇、语法方面都有自己的特点。作为汉语的不同方言，必须具备两个条件:①分布在不同地域;②是古代汉语的发展结果。汉语方言与汉语的关系是个别与一般的关系。随着社会的进步，经济的繁荣，方言的作用将逐渐变小。

Chinese dialect is a regional variant of the language of the Han nationality. The internal development of the Chinese dialect is subordinated to the common language of the whole nation, and at the same time it has its own characteristics different from other dialects in terms of speech, vocabulary and grammar. As different dialects of Chinese, they must meet two conditions: 1) They are distributed in different geographical areas; 2) They are the result of the development of the ancient Chinese language. The relationship between the Chinese dialects and the Chinese language is the relationship between the individual and the general. As society progresses and the economy prospers, the role of dialects will gradually diminish.

**III. Directions:** *Please translate the following passage into English.*

甲骨文(oracle bone script)是中国的一种古代文字，被认为是现代汉字的早期形式。甲骨文出现在商朝晚期。当时，王室为了占卜记事而在龟甲或兽骨上契刻文字。这是中国最早的成体系的文字形式，现代汉字就是由甲骨文演变而来。值得一提的是，甲骨文属于象形文字，即利用线条或笔画把物体的外形特征勾画出来。如今，汉字虽然还保留着象形文字的某些特征，但经过数千年的演变，已跟原来的形象相去甚远。

殷墟甲骨文的重大发现在中华文明乃至人类文明发展史上具有划时代的意义。甲骨文是迄今为止中国发现的年代最早的成熟文字系统，是汉字的源头和中华优秀传统文化的根脉，值得倍加珍视、更好传承发展。

The oracle bone script, a form of ancient Chinese writing, is considered as an early form of modern Chinese characters. It emerged in the late Shang Dynasty. At that time, royal families carved words on turtle shells or animal bones to keep a record of divination and events. This was China's earliest form of systematic writing, and it was from the oracle bone script that modern Chinese characters evolved. What is worth mentioning is that the oracle bone script belongs to pictograph—the use of lines or strokes to sketch out the appearance or the feature of a physical object. Today, Chinese characters still keep certain features of pictograph, but after thousands of years of evolution, they have become very different from their original looks.

The great discovery of the oracle bone script in Yinxu is of epoch-making significance in the history of Chinese civilization and even human civilization. The oracle bone script is the earliest dated mature writing system ever discovered in China. It is the source of Chinese characters and the root of excellent traditional Chinese culture, which deserves to be cherished and better inherited and developed.

The Peking Opera, once known as Ping Opera, is one of the five major Chinese opera genres. The Peking Opera is regarded as China's national treasure, with its tunes mainly based on Xi Pi and Er Huang, and accompanied by Huqin, gongs and drums, etc.

The predecessor of the Peking Opera is the Hui Opera. Since the 55th year of the Qianlong reign (1790) of the Qing dynasty, the four Hui operas, Sanqing, Sixi, Chuntai and Hechun, which used to perform in the south, entered Beijing one after another.

They cooperated with the opera artists from Hubei, but also embraced some of the repertoire, tunes and performance methods of Kunqu and Qinqiang, folk tunes, and eventually formed the Peking Opera through constant interaction and integration.

Beijing Opera has traveled around the world and become an important medium for introducing and spreading traditional Chinese art and culture. On november 16, 2010, Peking Opera was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

景泰蓝(the Chinese cloisonné)是中国著名的特种金属工艺品之一。到明代景泰年间这种工艺技术制作达到了巅峰，制作出的工艺品最为精美而著名，故后人称这种瓷器为"景泰蓝"。景泰蓝的装饰效果是这样形成的：首先要通过焊接(solder)或粘贴工艺用银线或金线给金属物件勾边，以将其分隔为几个小块。这些金银线在成品上依然能看到，它们将瓷釉或镶嵌物(enamel or inlays)的不同部分分隔开来，通常这些瓷釉或镶嵌物会有多种颜色。这项工艺至今在中国仍然很常见。

The Chinese cloisonné is one of the most famous special metal crafts in China. This technology reached its peak in the Ming Dynasty during the Jingtai period, producing the most exquisite and famous handicrafts. Therefore, this kind of porcelain was called "Jingtai Blue".The Cloisonné decoration is formed by first adding compartments to the metal object by soldering or sticking silver or gold threads placed on their edges, so as to separate it into several small pieces. These gold or silver threads remain visible in the finished piece, separating the different compartments of the enamel or inlays, which are often of several colors. The technique still remains common in China to the present day.

Bronze Ware is an instrument made of bronze alloy (an alloy of red copper and tin), which appeared during the Bronze Age of human civilization. Bronze was found all over the world and is a symbol of a cosmopolitan civilization. The earliest bronzes appeared 6,000 years ago in the two river valleys of ancient Babylon. Large bronze knives carved with the image of a lion during the Sumerian civilization are representative of early bronzes. Bronze was gradually replaced by iron over 2000 years ago. Chinese bronzes are beautifully made and enjoy a high reputation and artistic value in the world of bronzes, representing the superior technology and culture of China's 4,000 years of bronze development.

北京故宫，旧称为紫禁城，是中国明清两代的皇家宫殿。它位于北京中轴线的中心，是中国古代宫廷建筑之精华，是世界上现存规模最大、保存最为完整的木质结构古建筑之一。北京故宫被誉为世界五大宫之首（北京故宫、法国凡尔赛宫、英国白金汉宫、美国白宫、俄罗斯克里姆林宫）。

北京故宫于明成祖永乐四年（1406年）开始建设，以南京故宫为蓝本营建，到永乐十八年（1420年）建成。它是一座长方形城池，南北长961米，东西宽753米，四面围有高10米的城墙，城外有宽52米的护城河。紫禁城内的建筑分为外朝和内廷两部分。外朝的中心为太和殿、中和殿、保和殿，统称三大殿，是国家举行大典礼的地方。内廷的中心是乾清宫、交泰殿、坤宁宫，统称后三宫，是皇帝和皇后居住的正宫。

The imperial palace, formerly known as the Forbidden City, is a royal palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties in China. It is located in the center of Beijing's central axis and is the essence of ancient Chinese palace architecture. It is one of the world's largest and best-preserved timber-framed ancient buildings. The Forbidden City in Beijing is regarded as one of the top five palaces in the world (the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Palace of Versailles in France, Buckingham Palace in England, the White House in the United States, and the Kremlin in Russia).

The construction of the Forbidden City in Beijing began in the fourth year of Yongle, Ming Dynasty (1406) and was built on the model of the Forbidden City in Nanjing, and was completed in the 18th year of Yongle (1420). It is a rectangular city, 961 meters long from north to south and 753 meters wide from east to west, surrounded on all sides by walls 10 meters high and a moat 52 meters wide. The buildings in the Forbidden City are divided into two parts: the outer court and the inner court. The center of the outer court is the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony, and the Hall of Protection and Harmony, collectively known as the Three Great Halls, which are the places where the great ceremonies of the country are held. The center of the inner court was the Qianqing Palace, the Jiaotai Palace, and the Kunning Palace, collectively known as the Three Hougongs, which was the main palace where the emperor and empress lived.

Zhaozhou Bridge, also known as Anji Bridge, is located in Zhao County, Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, and spans over the river with a width of 37 meters. Because the bridge is made of stone, it is locally called the "big stone bridge".

Zhaozhou Bridge was built in 595-605 AD during the Sui Dynasty. It was designed and built by the famous craftsman Li Chun and has a history of more than 1400 years. It is the second oldest and best preserved ancient single-hole open-shoulder stone arch bridge in the world today. Zhaozhou Bridge is the brainchild of the ancient Chinese working people, having opened up a new horizon for bridge construction in China.
